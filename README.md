## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

My name is Hans KnÃ¶chel and I'm the Co-Founder and CEO of Lambus, a collaborative travel platform. You can find more information on Lambus [here](http://lambus.io/?ref=github)!

### Open Source

I spend some of my time in open source projects (roughly since 2014), primarily on iOS related projects as well as the [Appcelerator Titanium](https://www.appcelerator.com/) ecosystem (acquired by Axway in 2016).

### Sponsorship

I am leading the maintainence of roughly 70 open source libraries (180+ in total), many of them iOS-, Android,- or Titanium related. If you like using one
of my projects, I appreciate becoming a Github sponsor - more information can be found at my [sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/hansemannn). You're great!
